# Transient_venting
This python code accompanies an article published in Geophysical Research Letters by Kristopher Darnell and Peter Flemings.
The article was published in December of 2015.

In this code, we provide implementation of a calculation that determines the potential for "transient venting" given a set of input parameters.
The code solves for equations 2-4 of the article and presents several plots. 
To perform calculation, run "analytical_trvent.py" with a specified set of parameters.
We provide the option to use the thermodynamic equilibrium calculation used in the article ("Liu_mthd") or an empirical method ("Tish_mthd") that exists within the literature.

If you use this code for research purposes, please cite the following article.
